1) Create your .env file in /scraper. 
You can customize: number of pages to scrap, .json file name.


2) Build Docker image. This will take about 5 minutes.
docker compose build --no-cache


3) Run main.py. This will create .json file with scraped offers in /scraper. Offers are not yet geocoded.
docker compose up


4) If you want to scrap again, stop the containter and run it again:
docker compose down
docker compose up
