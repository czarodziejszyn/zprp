1. move .json with scrapped offers to geocoding directory

# Setting up Nominativ server:
2. log in to the docker in terminal: (you need to have docker account) 
docker login


3. 
Run:

docker run -d -p 6080:8080 -e NOMINATIM_PBF_URL="https://download.bbbike.org/osm/bbbike/Warsaw/Warsaw.osm.pbf" -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="haslo" --name nominatim-warsaw peterevans/nominatim:latest

And observe the logs:
docker logs -f nominatim-warsaw


Setup should take around 20-30min. 

After it is finished, you have Nominativ server ready at:
http://localhost:6080/ 


4. To stop / start anew:
docker stop nominatim-warsaw
docker start nominatim-warsaw

DO NOT delete an image, as it will have to go through the setup again.
